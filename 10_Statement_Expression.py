# Statement and Expression
# Statement is instruction
# Expression is a piece of code that can evaluate values (12*2) (12>2)

lenght = 12
width = 10

area = lenght * width # The whole line is statement # Lenght * width is expression

print(area)
print(lenght*width) # we can use expression directly in the print()
